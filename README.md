# hello-world
My name is AmStatic, I studied to be a programmer in 1986-1989 but since then I have not written a single line of code...  Yes the horror... I went over to the Dark side call Infrastructure.

I attended Build 202 0nline, and this has reignited in me the love for coding.

But now I am a noobie, There is no more BASIC, COBOL and RPG@, it is all now C++, c#, and something called RUST...  I thought rust was a bad thing.

Well this ramble is just to confirm that I can get VS Code working with my github.

Peace..
